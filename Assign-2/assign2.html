    <h1 class="header" align="center">Population</h1>
    <p class="para">The world population is increasing at a very fast pace. The last five to six decades have especially seen a tremendous growth in the human population. There are several reasons for the same. One of the main reasons for this is the development in the
        field of medical science that has brought down the death rate. Another reason is the growing birth rate especially in the poor and developing countries. Lack of education and lack of family planning are among the top reasons for the high birth
        rate in these countries.</p>
