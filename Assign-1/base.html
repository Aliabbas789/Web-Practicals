    <h1 align="center">A Small Biography</h1>
    <p>Aliabbas, grew up as the only child. He was really passionate about his dreams but the fear of failing at any point consumed him. But giving up was not a part of his life. He struggled hard for his family. Yet destiny had something else planned for
        him. He never knew what he wanted to achieve and kept on moving. Failures were a part of every work he did. He was demotivated every single time when he failed and never stopped trying to rise up twice than he failed. He never knew what would
        he become for himself and his family, a burden or a pride. But his family always supported him for his priceless efforts. People who have struggled a lot have a bright future ahead. But he was not at all convinced by this line. The rest of his
        life remained a mystery as I am only 19 years old.</p>
